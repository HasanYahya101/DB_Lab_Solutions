# Database Systems: Lab Solutions
## Spring 2024 (Fast Nuces Lhr)

This repository contains the solutions to the DB Lab questions from my lectures at the Spring 2024 semester at FAST NUCES Lhr. These solutions are intended to help students who are struggling with understanding the concepts and solving the assignments.

_**Note:** that these solutions are provided for the Lab (subject), not the theory subject. Therefore, they may not be useful for the theory subject. Moreover, [Microsoft SQL Server (Express)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) is being used as main Database Server for Executing SQL Queries. In addition to that, we need a server manager. You can use [Microsoft SQL Server Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) as Server Manager for Executing Queries, but i am using `mssql` extension is VSCode. Moreover, in the Labs that have a Practise Folder: The Files in that Folder are there to help the Students Understand how the Concept being Solved in the Lab works (be it the Syntax or How to setup the System before Solving Exercises), not to Solve them (although you can for Practise). The actual Exercise Questions that are to be solved, are in the Exercise (Lab Instructions) Manual. The Solutions to the Exercise Questions are in the SQL Source Code Files. While the SQL Schema Files are used to load the Database using which, you have to solve the Exercise Questions._
